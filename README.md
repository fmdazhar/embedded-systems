### Electronic Stability Control in Cars

#### Description
ESC in Indian cars is seen more as a luxury option rather than a necessary safety feature. This projects aims in creating a ESC module using the ST microcontroller which can be easily implemented to commercial cars in the Indian automotive market. The ESC module would include Directional Stability, Anti-Lock Braking, Traction control and Anti-Yawing.

#### Components
Accelerometer X 1, Gyroscope X 1, Linear Actuator X 4, RPM Sensor X 4, Servo Motor (6V) X 1, Motor Drive (L293D) X 1, Potentiometer Analog Rotation Sensor module X 2.
